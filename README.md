Linear Regression:</br>
Project contains the use of linear regression on the dataset focused on features and the quality of wines.</br>
It tries to predict the quality basing on the wine's features. Model learns the dependencies between the features
of wine and applies it to the prediction mechanism.</br> 

Matplotlib is used to visualize the data and predictions.</br> 

Important thing to notice is the ease with which we can substitute different feature/prediction in both KNN project and Linear Regression project. 
In this way we can predict values basing on different set of features or predict different features.
