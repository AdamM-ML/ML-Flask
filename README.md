# GENERAL
Math operations:</br>
Project's purpose is to present most Python techniques that I know while using them in cases where they are useful. Some of them are basic, some intermediate, but all of them
I understand and all .py files are written by me. Project's execution results are not original or very useful, but it was not the project's purpose and it is only for the purpose of having some kind of an easy output (within simple UI) that was created by using all presented techniques combined. </br>

To conclude, the juicy part of this project is not the output/execution of program, but the code itself. I believe the code is not perfect as far as the structure and
perfect coding habits are concerned, but thanks to code comments / docstrings I think its quite readable and understandable.

# Details
**Logging module** to produce log file after each execution;</br>
**Tkinter module** to design the UI;</br>
**Random module** to create methods that generate random numbers as the input to the operations;</br>
**MathOps class** where all mathematic operations methods and number generators are located;</br>
**TkUi class** that handles UI generation and design;</br>
**Other** the code that is not a part of class or functions serves as the part where the objects are created and the methods are called in order to prepare data displayed later in the UI;</br></br>
