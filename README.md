Chatbot:</br>
Project is a chatbot which attempts to help the user by answering his/her questions regarding the tools he/she can use on the computer e.g. to do their work like writing articles, drawing digital paintings, creating e-mail account etc.</br> The idea was to help people who have little experience with computers and had to switch to remote working style (e.g. due to Covid-19 epidemic).</br></br>
Chatbot provides answers all of which were checked for their legitimacy and in some cases provides web links to the places where we can download mentioned tools or read more about some topic.</br></br>
Project utilizes **regular expressions** to implement the AI algorithm and **tkinter** to create and handle UI. The algorithm analyzes user input and looks for the corresponding answer in the set of answers. Pairs: regular expression -> answers, handle finding the matching output. Important thing to notice is that my chatbot is question-answer based in order to reduce the time it takes to receive a specific answer. Instead of having a longer talk with the AI, I wanted the user to receive the straight answer without much unnecessary interaction.</br></br>

Future updates may be focused on adding more topics that the chatbot can handle, or optimizing the algorithm if the program encounters some delays. Rebuilding the UI may be considered when necessary, however, its current state is pretty decent.
