# FlaskDemo
 Flask based project:
 - Logging users, 
 - storing their information in database, 
 - updating database, deleting users,
 - page navigation.
 
 Project was written when learning Flask and is based on my own idea. Its purpose would be to assign and modify tasks of specific users and store them in the database along with the creation/deletion of users.
