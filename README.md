Project depicts the use of SVM classification method to create the prediction model.
I used the dataset from sklearn datasets, I did not include any additional external data files unlike in linear regression and KNN projects.
After creating the model I used the same dataset to create model using linear regression and KNN methods. 
Accuracies were compared and we can see that in this case SVM achieves the best one, however, the accuracy depends not only on the classifier
but also on the parameters we use in them, like kernel or soft margin values in the case of SVM and depends also on the dataset itself. 
That is why it is reasonable in my opinion to check out more than one classification method to get the best model possible as well as manipulate the parameters/algorithm
of each classifier to increase the accuracy.
