# GENERAL
Math operations:</br>
Project's purpose is to present most Python techniques that I know while using them in cases where they are useful. Some of them are basic, some intermediate but all of them
I understand and all .py files are written by me. Project's execution results are not original or very useful, but it was not the project's purpose and it is only for the purpose of
having some kind of an easy output that was created by using all presented techniques combined. </br>

To conclude, the juicy part of this project is not the output/execution of program, but the code itself. I believe the code is not perfect as far as the structure and
perfect coding habits are concerned, but thanks to code comments / docstrings I think its quite readable and understandable.
